Project for Enalyzer creating an ATM machine. 

This is a dotnet project, and is run by commands:
  dotnet build
  dotnet run

The project was build using 'Create React App', but the modifications made by me is in the components.

The main focus has been on funcitonality and styling (there is a smaller flaw with the posistion styling of the '0' button and 'back button'. 
Testing has not been a focus point due to lack of time and knowledge, but testing have been made in the sense of consolelogs.
